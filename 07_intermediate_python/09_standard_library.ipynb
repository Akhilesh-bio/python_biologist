Let me know if this scenario sounds familiar: You are doing feature engineering and since you love lists, you just keep appending the features to a list, which you then feed into your machine learning model. Soon, you might have hundreds of features and that’s when things get messy. You no longer remember which feature refers to which index in your list. Worse, when someone else looks at your code, they have no idea what is going on with this monstrous list of features.\n",
