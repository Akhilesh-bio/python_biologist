    "When starting a new Python project, it is tempting to just dive in and start coding. Spending a tiny amount of time to setup a project with the best tools will save immense time and lead to a happier coding experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, dependencies would be identical for all developers, code would be perfectly formatted, common errors forbidden and everything would be covered by tests. Additionally, all of these would ensured at each commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article I'll go through how to set up a project that does exactly that. You can either follow along with the steps or jump straight to generating a new project automatically by installing [pipx](#pipx) and [pipenv](#pipenv) then [generating a new project](#generate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a new project directory:\n",

    "    cd best_practices\n",

    "# <a name=\"pipx\"></a>Python command line tools with pipx\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) is a handy utility that allows quick installation of python command line tools. We'll be using it to install pipenv and cookiecutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    python3 -m pip install --user pipx\n",
    "    python3 -m pipx ensurepath\n",

    "# <a name=\"pipenv\"></a>Dependency management with pipenv\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adding/removing packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important Pipfile.lock, which is used to produce deterministic builds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that you and your teammates are using the same library versions is a huge confidence boost. Pipenv takes care of this and has gained massive traction in the last year or so.\n",

    "# Code formatting with black and isort\n",
    "\n",
    "[Black](https://github.com/psf/black) formats our code:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Black makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "while [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) sorts our imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "> isort your python imports for you so you don't have to. isort is a Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's install them using pipenv as development dependencies so they don't clutter a deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pipenv install black isort --dev\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Black and isort have incompatible default options so we'll override isort to follow black's lead. Create a `setup.cfg` file and add this config:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [isort]\n",
    "    multi_line_output=3\n",
    "    include_trailing_comma=True\n",
    "    force_grid_wrap=0\n",
    "    use_parentheses=True\n",
    "    line_length=88\n",
    "\n",
    "We can run these tools with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pipenv run black\n",
    "    pipenv run isort\n",
    "\n",
    "# Style enforcement with flake8\n",
    "\n",
    "Flake8 ensures our code follows the standard python conventions as defined in PEP8\\. Install using pipenv:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pipenv install flake8 --dev\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like isort it needs a little configuration to work well with black. Add this config to `setup.cfg`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [flake8]\n",
    "    ignore = E203, E266, E501, W503\n",
    "    max-line-length = 88\n",
    "    max-complexity = 18\n",
    "    select = B,C,E,F,W,T4\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can run flake8 with `pipenv run flake8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Static types with mypy\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) is an optional static type checker for Python that aims to combine the benefits of dynamic (or \"duck\") typing and static typing. Mypy combines the expressive power and convenience of Python with a powerful type system and compile-time type checking. Mypy type checks standard Python programs; run them using any Python VM with basically no runtime overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having types in Python takes a little getting used to but the benefits are substantial. From the website:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Static typing can make programs easier to understand and maintain\n",
    "*   Static typing can help you find bugs earlier and with less testing and debugging\n",
    "*   Static typing can help you find difficult-to-find bugs before your code goes into production\n",
    "\n",
    "    pipenv install mypy --dev\n",
    "\n",
    "Mypy by default will recursively check all imports for type annotations which leads to errors when libraries do not include these annotations. We need to configure mypy to run only on our code and to ignore any errors for imports without type annotations. We are assuming that our code lives in the `best_practices` package for the following config. Add this to `setup.cfg`:\n",

    "> Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review. We run our hooks on every commit to automatically point out issues in code such as missing semicolons, trailing whitespace, and debug statements. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks.\n",
