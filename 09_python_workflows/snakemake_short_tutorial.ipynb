    "Here we provide a short tutorial that guides you through the main features of Snakemake. Note that this is not suited to learn Snakemake from scratch, rather to give a first impression. To really learn Snakemake (starting from something simple, and extending towards advanced features), use the main [Snakemake Tutorial](tutorial.html#tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "This document shows all steps performed in the official [Snakemake live demo](https://youtu.be/hPrXcUUp70Y), such that it becomes possible to follow them at your own pace. Solutions to each step can be found at the bottom of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples presented in this tutorial come from Bioinformatics. However, Snakemake is a general-purpose workflow management system for any discipline. For an explanation of the steps you will perform here, have a look at [Background](basics.html#tutorial-background). More thorough explanations are provided in the full [Snakemake Tutorial](tutorial.html#tutorial).\n",
