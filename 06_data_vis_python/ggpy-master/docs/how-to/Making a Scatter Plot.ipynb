    "#### Simple X/Y Plot\n",
    "The simplest plot you can make is an x/y plot. To do this in ggplot, first create a base layer using the `ggplot` function. Pass in your data and aesthetics that map columns in your DataFrame to `x` and `y`. In this case, we're going to look at the relationship between car weight (`wt`) and miles per gallon (`mpg`), so we'll set the x value of our aesthetics to `wt` and the y value to `mpg`.\n",

To do this, just include definitions for the aesthetic you'd like to control. For instance, let's set the color of each point in our graph to the acceleration (`qsec`) of each car."
