    "The Biopython Project is an international association of developers of freely available Python (http://www.python.org) tools for computational molecular biology. Python is an object oriented, interpreted, flexible language that is becoming increasingly popular for scientific computing. Python is easy to learn, has a very clear syntax and can easily be extended with modules written in C, C++ or FORTRAN.\n",

    "The Biopython web site (http://www.biopython.org) provides an online resource for modules, scripts, and web links for developers of Python-based software for bioinformatics use and research. Basically, the goal of Biopython is to make it as easy as possible to use Python for bioinformatics by creating high-quality, reusable modules and classes. Biopython features include parsers for various Bioinformatics file formats (BLAST, Clustalw, FASTA, Genbank,...), access to online services (NCBI, Expasy,...), interfaces to common and not-so-common programs (Clustalw, DSSP, MSMS...), a standard sequence class, various clustering modules, a KD tree data structure etc. and even documentation.\n",

    "  - EMBOSS command line tools\n",
    "-A standard sequence class that deals with sequences, ids on sequences, and sequence features.\n",
    "- Tools for performing common operations on sequences, such as translation, transcription and weight calculations.\n",
    "- Code to perform classification of data using k Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "- Code for dealing with alignments, including a standard way to create and deal with substitution matrices.\n",
    "- Code making it easy to split up parallelizable tasks into separate processes.\n",
    "- GUI-based programs to do basic sequence manipulations, translations, BLASTing, etc.\n",
    "- Extensive documentation and help with using the modules, including this file, on-line wiki documentation, the web site, and the mailing list.\n",
